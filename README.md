# Faces-DCGAN-SAGAN

The aim of this project is to learn and implement generative models based on
differentiable generator networks, mainly Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)
and Self-Attention GAN (SA-GAN). Project requirements include:
• Implementation of Deep Convolutional GAN and Self-Attention GAN consisting of a Generator (G) and Discriminator (D) using the CIFAR10 dataset.
• Applying Spectral Normalization (SN) on G and D.
• Implementation of self-attention (SA) GAN module
• Implementation of Wasserstein Loss function for the training
• Applying Frechet Inception Distance (FID) as an evaluation metric and validating the training epochs using FID with a validation set.
• Computing the FID score during training at every 500 iterations and visualising the attention layers
